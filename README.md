These are the notes that I took while taking the course "Introduction to Kubernetes" on edX.
Course: https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-kubernetes

I would highly recommend this course as an introductory course to Kubernetes and container orchestration. These notes aren't replacements for the actual course material. Suggestions/edits/contributions are welcome.
