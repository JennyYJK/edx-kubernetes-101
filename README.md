These are the notes that I took while taking the course "Introduction to Kubernetes" on edX.
Course: https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-kubernetes

I would highly recommend this course as an introductory course to Kubernetes and container orchestration.
These notes aren't replacements for the actual course material.
Suggestions/edits/contributions are welcome.
Pictures are screenshots from the course and it didn't get exported nicely into `.md` so I exported from my notetaking software as PDF as well.
