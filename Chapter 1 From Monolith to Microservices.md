# Chapter 1 From Monolith to Microservices
- Monolith: large single piece of software which continuously grows
	- Has to be run on expensive and bulky hardware
- Microservices: lightweight applications packaged with dependencies
	- Can be deployed individually on separate & modular servers with fewer resources
	- Event-driven architecture and service-oriented architecture principles
	- Communicate through APIs over a network
	- 	Modular => Scalable
